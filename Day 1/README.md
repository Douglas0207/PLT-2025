Your markdown is almost perfect, but there's a small syntax issue at the top: you're opening a code block with \`\`\`\`markdown but never closing it. Also, markdown syntax like `### Description` should not be inside a code block unless you want it rendered as plain text.

# Java Revision: Array and HashMap-Based Problems

This repository contains three commonly asked Java problems, focused on mastering arrays, sets, maps, and greedy logic. All functions are organized inside a single class `Day1.java` and executed using a separate `Main.java` class.

## Problem 1: Intersection of Two Arrays

### Method Signature

```java
public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2)
````

### Description

Finds the unique intersection elements between two integer arrays using HashSet for constant time lookup and duplicate elimination.

### Example

```java
Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2]
Output: [2]
```

## Problem 2: Subarray Sum Equals K

### Method Signature

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] arr, int k)
```

### Description

Counts the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`. Uses prefix sum and HashMap to store the frequency of sums encountered.

### Example

```java
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: [1, 2] and [3]
```

## Problem 3: Patching Array

### Method Signature

```java
public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n)
```

### Description

Determines the minimum number of patches (numbers) to add to the array so that all numbers in the range \[1, n] can be formed using sums of the array elements. Implements a greedy strategy using a variable to track the current coverage range.

### Example

```java
Input: nums = [1, 3], n = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Patch added is 2 to complete the range
```

## How to Compile and Run

1. Save both `Day1.java` and `Main.java` in the same directory.
2. Compile the files:

```bash
javac Day1.java Main.java
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
java Main
```

## Summary Table

| Problem               | Concepts Used       | Data Structures Used |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Intersection          | Arrays, Hashing     | HashSet              |
| Subarray Sum Equals K | Prefix Sum, HashMap | HashMap              |
| Patching Array        | Greedy, Array Math  | None (Math logic)    |

## Purpose

This repository is created as part of Java coding revision, focused on:

* HashMap and HashSet usage
* Prefix sum technique
* Greedy algorithm implementation
* Clean structure and reusable code

```
