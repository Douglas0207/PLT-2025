# Placement Training â€“ Saveetha Engineering College

Welcome to my **Placement Training Repository**!  
This repository documents my daily progress during the **4-week placement training** conducted by **Saveetha Engineering College** for the **2026 batch**.

Each day includes solutions to:

*  1 Easy LeetCode Problem  
*  1 Medium LeetCode Problem  
*  1 Hard LeetCode Problem

All problems are organized in **day-wise folders**, with clear Java solutions and explanations.
